# Pizza shop

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page also is public [https://new-pizza-shop.vercel.app/](https://new-pizza-shop.vercel.app/0)

Now the data comes from mocapi, this is temporary, I will write the backend in two versions.
The first one is in Java Spring Boot and the second one is in Laravel.

Keep in mind i added in env BROWSER=none, so after npm start you should open manually in browser http://localhost:3000
