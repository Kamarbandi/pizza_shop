In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


Sping Boot is running in http://localhost:8083/



Keep in mind i added in env BROWSER=none, so after npm start you should open manually in browser http://localhost:3000
